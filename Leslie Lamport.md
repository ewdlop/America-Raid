To formally express the idea that **mathematics is the intermediary language**, we can define a framework using **category theory** and **formal languages**.

### **Mathematical Formulation:**
We define:

- \( L_E \) as the space of human languages (e.g., English, Mandarin, etc.).
- \( L_M \) as the space of mathematical expressions (symbols, equations, structures).
- \( C \) as the space of concepts in nature (physics, logic, etc.).
- \( T_E: C \to L_E \) as a translation function mapping concepts to a human language.
- \( T_M: C \to L_M \) as a translation function mapping concepts to mathematics.
- \( T_{EM}: L_E \to L_M \) as a transformation from human language to mathematical language.
- \( T_{ME}: L_M \to L_E \) as a transformation from mathematics back to human language.

Mathematically, we assert:

```math
T_{EM} \circ T_E \approx T_M
```
which means that **the translation from concepts to mathematics directly is approximately the same as translating concepts into human language first and then into mathematics**.

Additionally, for rigorous science and engineering:

```math
T_{ME} \circ T_M = L_E
```
implies that translating mathematical structures into human language is necessary for interpretation but does not change their fundamental meaning.

### **Category-Theoretic Interpretation:**

Define a **category** \( \mathcal{C} \) of concepts, a **category** \( \mathcal{M} \) of mathematical structures, and a **category** \( \mathcal{L} \) of human languages. The **functor**:

```math
F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{M}
```
exists and is **faithful**, meaning it preserves structure and meaning precisely. However, the functor:

```math
G: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{L}
```
is not faithful, as human languages introduce **ambiguity, redundancy, and subjectivity**.

Thus, **mathematics is the best intermediary between raw concepts and human languages**, because the **mapping between concepts and mathematics is precise, reversible, and structural**, unlike human languages.

Would you like me to expand on a different mathematical framework, such as **information theory** or **formal logic**?
