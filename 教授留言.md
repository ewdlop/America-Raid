**Resimetric Move** and **Knot Polynomials** are concepts from the field of **knot theory**, which is a branch of topology dealing with the study of knots, their properties, and their invariants.

### **Resimetric Move**
A "resimetric move" is likely referring to a type of **Reidemeister move**. Reidemeister moves are the basic transformations used to study and manipulate knots and links without changing their fundamental structure (i.e., they don't transform one knot into another).

#### **Three Reidemeister Moves**:
1. **Type I**: Adding or removing a twist in the knot.
2. **Type II**: Sliding one loop over another.
3. **Type III**: Sliding one strand of the knot over a crossing of two others.

These moves are critical in proving that two knot diagrams represent the same knot. They are used to simplify knots and define knot invariants.

### **Knot Polynomials**
Knot polynomials are mathematical invariants that uniquely characterize certain properties of a knot. They are used to distinguish between different knots and study their topology.

#### **Common Knot Polynomials**:
1. **Alexander Polynomial**:
   - One of the first discovered knot polynomials.
   - Derived using a Seifert matrix of the knot.

2. **Jones Polynomial**:
   - One of the most famous knot polynomials.
   - Derived from the braid representation of the knot.
   - It satisfies a recursive skein relation:
     \[
     V(L_+) - V(L_-) = (t^{1/2} - t^{-1/2})V(L_0)
     \]
     where \(L_+\), \(L_-\), and \(L_0\) are diagrams differing only at a single crossing.

3. **HOMFLY-PT Polynomial**:
   - A generalization of the Alexander and Jones polynomials.
   - It satisfies:
     \[
     lP(L_+) + l^{-1}P(L_-) + mP(L_0) = 0
     \]
     where \(l\) and \(m\) are parameters, and the terms \(L_+\), \(L_-\), and \(L_0\) are again related by a crossing change.

4. **Kauffman Polynomial**:
   - Another generalization that includes information about links.

---

### **Connection Between Moves and Polynomials**
- Reidemeister moves ensure that the polynomial invariants do not change when the diagram of the knot is altered (e.g., simplified or manipulated).
- This property is essential because it makes knot polynomials **topological invariants**.

---

### **Applications of Knot Polynomials**:
1. **Distinguishing Knots**: Different knots have different polynomials (though not always uniquely).
2. **Biology**: Understanding DNA supercoiling and protein folding.
3. **Physics**: Applications in quantum field theory and string theory.
4. **Cryptography**: Knot theory has been proposed for secure systems due to its computational complexity.
