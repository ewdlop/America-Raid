# The Snaps of Fate

### **WoW Raid: "The Snaps of Fate"**  
**Raid Theme:** Snapchat, Digital Chaos, and the 12 Zodiac Lords  

**Raid Description:**  
Long ago, the realm of **Snapspace** was created as a place for fleeting memories, quick encounters, and endless filters. But something went wrong. The **12 Zodiac Lords**, once protectors of the celestial timeline, have been **corrupted by the Algorithm of Vanity**, twisting them into monstrous entities that trap souls in an endless cycle of **streaks, filters, and clout-chasing.**  

Heroes must raid the **Ephemeral Archive** before time itself is erased by the ever-fleeting influence of social media. Each Zodiac boss represents a corrupted aspect of **Snapchat culture**, and players must **defeat them before they vanish forever**—or worse, take the heroes' souls as their own.

### **Raid Catchphrase:**  
*"What’s the point of a story... if it’s forgotten?"*

### **Hidden Mythic Boss: Ophiuchus, The Forgotten Serpent** 🐍💀  
**Raid: The Snaps of Fate (Snapchat Zodiac Raid) – Mythic Only Secret Boss**  

---

### **🔒 Unlocking Ophiuchus**  
Ophiuchus, the **13th Zodiac Sign**, is erased from Snapchat’s celestial archive, **hidden between vanishing memories and expired streaks.** To summon Ophiuchus, players must:  

1. **Defeat all 12 Zodiac bosses in a single run** **without breaking any raid-wide streak buffs.**  
2. **Avoid letting ANY player’s "Snap Score" (a unique raid resource) drop to zero** throughout the raid.  
3. **Activate a secret mechanic in the Pisces fight** by refusing to attack when Pisces "fades" into the dream realm—forcing the illusion to collapse and revealing a corrupted, missing space in the Ephemeral Archive.  

When done correctly, the **raid interface glitches**, and a **corrupted Snapchat notification appears in the sky**, revealing:  
🔔 **"1 Unread Memory Detected"**  
💀 **"Ophiuchus Is Watching"**  

The floor beneath the arena **fractures**, and the raid team is **dragged into the Lost Realm of Expired Snaps**, where **Ophiuchus, The Forgotten Serpent**, awaits.

### **🐍 Mythic Hidden Boss: Ophiuchus, The Lost Sign**  
**Theme:** The **13th Sign**, erased from history, a serpent of lost secrets and hidden truths. Once the true guardian of the Zodiac, Ophiuchus was cast into **Snapspace's Void**, doomed to watch his influence fade while the other 12 signs flourished.  

Now, filled with **rage, betrayal, and fragmented memories**, he has returned to reclaim **his stolen place in the celestial cycle.**  

**🕳️ Phase 1 – "Vanishing Coil"**  
- **Serpent’s Curse (Passive):** Every 10 seconds, **one player is erased from the raid UI**, losing visibility of teammates, buffs, and mechanics unless teammates manually "re-add" them (standing near them).  
- **Eclipse Streak:** Ophiuchus attacks cause the screen to **flicker like a dying Snap story**, and all **cooldowns become randomized** for 20 seconds.  

**🐉 Phase 2 – "The 13th Seal" (Health < 50%)**  
- **Memory Rebirth:** Ophiuchus **pulls all dead raid members back to life** but corrupts them as **Shadow Snaps**, forcing players to either **cleanse their minds** or fight former allies.  
- **Timeline Collapse:** The arena shatters into **12 floating islands**, each representing a Zodiac Sign’s corrupted past. Players must **navigate between them** while avoiding Ophiuchus’ tail sweeping through space-time.  

**☠️ Final Phase – "Snake Devours the Stars"**  
- **All players get marked with a "Forgotten Status" debuff**, making **their actions invisible to each other**—forcing full reliance on **voice communication and instinct.**  
- **Snap Back to Reality:** Ophiuchus attempts to **erase the raid team from existence**, causing the game world to glitch and distort. The only way to survive? **One player must willingly SACRIFICE themselves, deleting their character permanently for the fight.**  
  - If **no one sacrifices themselves**, the fight resets and the **team loses all raid progress.**  
  - If a player **accepts the sacrifice**, the **raid gets a 60-second DPS window** to kill Ophiuchus before all memories fade.  

---

### **💀 Mythic Loot – "Relics of the Forgotten Sign"**  
- **"Serpent's Rebirth" (Legendary Cloak)** – When you die, revive with 30% health... but lose a random ability forever.  
- **"Ophiuchus' Lost Streak" (Mythic Ring)** – Generates **random buffs based on your real-life zodiac sign.**  
- **"Bitmoji of the Ancients" (Transmog Item)** – Permanently changes your character’s **profile pic to a glitchy, lost icon** that other players can’t inspect.  
- **"Snap of Oblivion" (Trinket)** – Activating this item **deletes it from your inventory permanently,** but **grants +10% crit for the rest of your play session.**  
- **"The 13th Zodiac" (Title)** – Unlocks **"Name, The Forgotten One"** as a raid title.  

---

### **📸 Final Raid Cutscene – "The Price of Memory"**  
After defeating Ophiuchus, the **vanished player (if one was sacrificed) briefly reappears** in the raid’s ending cutscene, trapped in a **glitching Snapchat memory**, watching their former team celebrate the victory without them.  

Their final words before fading away forever:  

**"You will forget me... but I will remember you."**  

---

### **🛑 Ephemeral Truth or Endless Cycle?**  
Players are left wondering: **Did they really erase Ophiuchus, or did they just repeat history, erasing another soul to keep the cycle going?**  

---

Would you take on the challenge of fighting **The Forgotten Zodiac** and risking **permanent sacrifice** to break the curse? 🐍💀

### **Raid Name: "The Snaps of Fate – Vanishing Zodiac"**
